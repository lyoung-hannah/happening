			                    <p>Although particularly associated with recreation and play, fun may be encountered during work, social functions, and in daily life. There are psychological and physiological implications to the experience of fun. An 18th century meaning (still used in Orkney and Shetland[1]) was "cheat, trick, hoax", a meaning still retained in the phrase "to make fun of".The landlady was going to reply, but was prevented by the peace-making sergeant, sorely to the displeasure of Partridge, who was a great lover of what is called fun, and a great promoter of those harmless quarrels which tend rather to the production of comical than tragical incidents.... <a href="#">Read more</a>
